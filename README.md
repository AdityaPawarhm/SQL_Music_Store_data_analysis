**##Database and tools**
Originally PostgreSQL and PgAdmin4 was used by the curator.
I have used Microsoft SQL server and SSMS 2022 to make this project.

After downloading the csv files , I imported the flat files in SSMS2022. I have made necessary changes in the tables so it can represent below schema
